# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan applicant will default or not. The data is provided by Home Credit and includes demographic, financial, and historical loan information. Due to a high class imbalance, special care is taken to build a robust and fair model.
